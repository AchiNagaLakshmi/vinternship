When I started my MERN journey through this virtual internship, everything felt confusing at first. The concepts were new, and I wasn’t sure how all the technologies fit together. There were moments of doubt, but I decided to stay consistent and take the learning one step at a time.
The live coding sessions became the most interesting part of the internship for me. Watching the code being written live helped me understand how things actually work, instead of just learning theory. The case studies were very helpful because they allowed me to apply what I learned during the live coding sessions in a practical way, which made the concepts clearer and easier to remember.
I also really enjoyed the quizzes, as they helped me check my understanding and improve my confidence. Each quiz felt like a small checkpoint in my learning journey and motivated me to do better.
This journey has been more about learning and small improvements rather than perfection. From confusion to small wins, this MERN journey has helped me gain confidence, and I’m looking forward to learning more and growing further.
